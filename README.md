To run these codes you will need access to Python 2.7 and the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)
Python 2.7: https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.4/
ASE: https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/

We have written the codes to be command-line executable, so a linux operating system is recommended.

The basic workflow for these codes is as follows

1. Run '< ./CNS {}.xyz >' to generate the coordination number file '{}_cns.xyz'

2. Run '< ./BC_SRB_Model {}_cns.xyz >' on the newly generated CNS file to calculate the BC/SRB model Cohesive Energies 

The Files are as follows:

BC_SRB_Model - python code that takes in a modified .xyz file and evaluates the BC/SRB model Cohesive Energy

CNS - python code that takes in a regular .xyz file and generates coordination numbers (CNS) and bonding topologies for a given MNP structure and generates a modified .xyz file with this information

EE_analysisFePt - python code used to analyze the excess energy of the large FePt nanoalloy used in Yang et al. Nature 2017, 542, 75-70

FePt_cns_final.xyz - modified .xyz file with CNS and bonding topology as an example of the output from the CNS code and for use in the EE_analysisFePt code

WF_refer_1.csv - csv file containing the data used in the BC model for the dimer binding energy weight factors (Primary Source)

WF_refer_2.csv - csv file containing secondary data for use in the BC model for the dimer binding energy weight factors
